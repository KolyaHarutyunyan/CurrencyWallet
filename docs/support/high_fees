Why the fees is so high? Other wallets has lower fees. 

Most likely your transaction SIZE is very large. Mining fee for every transaction depends on count of input and output transactions. The size increases by 

# 1. Due to many small input trasnactions to "sender" wallet. (posible 2x, 3x, 10x, 20x higher than normal ! )

Normal scenario. 
1. user deposits 100$ to the wallet
2. suer send 10$, $20 etc. The mining fee is normal in this case.

Worse scenario. 
1. user deposits $2, $3, $5, $5, $50, etc.. 
2. try to spend ALL from the balance
3. in this case the mining fee will be highers.

1. If this user try to send only 2$ it reuires only 1 input sign (because it's enough). 
2. But if the user try to send the entire balance it requires 8x more inputs. And size of tranassction is higher than normal. 

# admin fee enabled (30% higher than normal)
If "admin fee" enabled on your wallet - it adds +1 OUTOUT bitcoin address (admin's) to every trasaction. 

# user uses multisig or pin-protected wallet (+30% higher than normal, up to 10x if many small inputs to be signed)
2fa wallets (pin-protected) requres 1 extra signature for every input (from our authorization server)
